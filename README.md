## Screenshots for mock-ups

The mock-ups below are created using the Justinmind wire-framing tool. I chose to use this tool since it has almost every prototype created from a default template, within which default styles have been defined for all UI elements, such as text boxes and data lists and grids. These makes it easy to modify to meet my needs.
